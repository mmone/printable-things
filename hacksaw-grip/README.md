This is an ergonomic grip that accepts a standard 12mm / 1/2 inch wide metal hacksaw blade. It is very useful to get into small spaces and to make flush cutoffs and allows to recycle broken or partially worn blades.

In addition to the printed piece you will need a ca. 3x18mm pin to lock in the blade.

The piece is best printed standing on the back end as positioned in the STL. Support is not needed. Only the hole at the back end could use some support if you want it to look pretty.

I printed with a 0.4mm nozzle, 4 walls, 7mm cubic infill distance.


Happy printing
