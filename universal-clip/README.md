A customizable Clip that can be used for example to fix a spool on an axis.
Originally designed to be used with the customizable spool hub shown in the picture: [(Springy Spool Hub) https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2334107](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2334107)

As this thing was constructed in [openSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/documentation.html) you can adapt it to your requirements in [Customizer](https://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=2356396).
####FAQ - What does "customizable" mean?

Customizable means that you can modify the model by changing the parameters that define it. In case of this thing you can modify for example the diameter of the rod, spring pretension etc. just by changing the respective numbers in the Customizer App.
The beautiful thing with parametric models is that you can adapt something to your needs without understanding the underlying design principles. Give it a try by clicking ["Open in Customizer"](https://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=2356396).

The design prints well with rigid PLA. Actually I found PLA optimal for this. PETG is to malleable.
Print with perimeters only, no infill, no top/bottom. If infill is used the spring looses its flexibility. 
For the model generated with the default settings use 4 perimeters/walls as the spring part is 8 extrusion width wide.

Happy Printing
