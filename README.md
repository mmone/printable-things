Some 3D printable things I designed that might be useful to others.

Most of them come with either [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) or [Fusion 360](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-activate-start-up-or-educational-licensing-for-Fusion-360.html) source files.
