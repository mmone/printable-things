This is a mounting bracket for the DJI CrystalSky display. It was originally designed for this [console](http://www.ahltec.de/shop/product_info.php?language=de&info=p614_set1-dji-inspire---in-black---mit-senderpult--fpv-erweiterung---tablethalterung.html) but might be useful in other mounting situations as well. The Fusion360 files are included in the download if you need to modify it for your needs.

In addition to the print you need two M5 screws to mount the display. I have included two printable thumbscrew heads. One for a hex and one for a cylinderhead screw.
I you use a cylinderhead screw, file down the head to form two parallel flats. This prevents the screw from rotating in the plastic part. The optimal width to file to is 5.5mm

The bracket has recesses for rubber pads. You can either print these with TPU or cut them from 1mm rubber sheet as I did.

Apart from that you only need 2-3 M3 screws to mount the bracket to the console.

There are two versions of the bracket in the download. The only difference is that one has thinner walls. This one should be plenty strong enough as well. It is optimised to be printed with a 0,4mm nozzle with at least 4 walls/shells.

Happy Printing.
